        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Adeeb Ahmed, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the City College of New York. My passion for technology, particularly in software development and cybersecurity, has been a driving force in my academic and professional journey.

My interest in IT began early, and I have steadily built upon my skills through coursework, personal projects, and practical experience. I am particularly drawn to the dynamic and ever-evolving field of cybersecurity, where I have developed a solid understanding of network security protocols, encryption algorithms, and threat detection strategies.

Currently, I am gaining invaluable experience as a Network Engineer Intern at Verizon, where I am involved in optimizing network performance and ensuring seamless connectivity for users. This role has allowed me to apply my classroom knowledge to real-world challenges, further honing my skills in network infrastructure and telecommunications.</p>
